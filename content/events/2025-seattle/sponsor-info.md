## Thank you for sponsoring DevOpsDays Seattle

As you probably know, DevOpsDays is a volunteer run not-for-profit event. Our goal is to help people learn about DevOps, and we couldn’t do it without your support. Thank You!!

### Book your hotel rooms

A lot of hotels in Seattle sell out in the spring. It’s a good idea to book any rooms you’ll need as soon as possible. We don't have an official hotel, but there are many in the area.

### Register your attendees

You’ll receive a registration code to be given to people who will be attending on behalf of your company. Please don’t wait to have them register once you receive your code! We’d like to have an accurate count as soon as possible.

## Who to send

Of course this is up to you, but most attendees will be practitioners. It’s
important to your success that you send people able to have practitioner level
conversations. If you’re showing off your latest product, be ready to answer
some technical questions. If you’re looking to hire people, have someone there
who works in the type of role you’re hiring for.

### Conference Format

DevOpsDays is a unique blend of presentation style talks and interactive open
discussions. The presentations are being chosen from over 200 submissions. We’re
really excited about the talks we’ll see.

The afternoons are run as open spaces. You can learn more about this format
at <https://www.devopsdays.org/open-space-format/>. To make the most of your
participation it’s highly recommended that your staff participate in the open
space discussions. This is your best chance to show off how valuable you can
be to the attendees.

### Shipping

The venue supports shipping and manages all shipping, plan to have packages arrive on September 7th, for the setup day on September 8th.

### Loading / Unloading at venue

### Sponsor Tables

Gold sponsors will be able to choose the location in the venue of your sponsor table. Once we have finalized the layout in the last week of April we will send out emails to sponsors in batches of 5 per day in the order the sponsorship was paid for. The email will contain a link to a page where you can choose your sponsor table. It's very important that you choose your table as soon as you receive this email for the best choice.

With that said, we've been told that we have one of the most welcoming sponsor areas of any DevOpsDays event and will do everything in our power to make sure there's no such thing as a "bad table spot".

### Lead Collection / Prize Draw

We don’t share attendee information with sponsors.

You’re welcome to ask people to share their contact information voluntarily.
It’s very common for sponsors to hold prize raffles for this purpose and we will have
a time at the end of day 2 to announce winners.

Approaches that have worked well in the past include doing a raffle for a prize at the end of the event, handing out swag, participating in a challenge to win a prize, etc. Types of prizes that have been well received: (exclusive) Lego sets, wireless headphones, mechanical keyboards, stickers, etc. Try to make it as easy as possible for attendees to enter, a short URL or QR code they can scan to direct them to a page or form to enter, or paper to add their details into a bowl for the draw.
